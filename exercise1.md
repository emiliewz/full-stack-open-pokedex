### 1. Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building.
In the JavaScript ecosystem, there are several popular tools for setting up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines with steps like linting, testing, and building. Here are some of the common tools:

1. **Linting**:

   - **ESLint**: A widely used linter for JavaScript, it helps identify and fix problems in your JavaScript code, ensuring it follows a consistent coding style.
   - **TSLint** (for TypeScript): A linter for TypeScript projects that helps enforce a consistent coding style.

2. **Testing**:

   - **Jest**: A popular JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It's widely used for testing JavaScript and React applications.
   - **Mocha**: A flexible testing framework that supports various assertion libraries.
   - **Jasmine**: A behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

3. **Building**:

   - **Webpack**: A popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It can be configured to handle tasks like bundling, minification, and more.
   - **Rollup**: Another module bundler that focuses on producing smaller, optimized bundles for libraries and packages.
   - **Parcel**: A zero-configuration, web application bundler that automatically handles tasks like bundling, minification, and more.

4. **CI/CD Services**:

   - **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating projects.
   - **Travis CI**: A cloud-based CI service that is widely used for open-source projects. It can be integrated with GitHub repositories.
   - **CircleCI**: Another cloud-based CI/CD service that provides powerful customization options for building, testing, and deploying.

### 2. Alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions:

There are several alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for setting up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. Here are some popular ones:

1. Travis CI:
   cloud-based CI service that integrates well with GitHub repositories. It's easy to configure and supports a wide range of programming languages and platforms.

2. CircleCI:
   Another cloud-based CI/CD service that provides powerful customization options for building, testing, and deploying applications. It supports multiple programming languages and platforms.

3. GitLab CI/CD:
   Integrated with GitLab repositories, it provides a powerful way to define CI/CD workflows using .gitlab-ci.yml files. It offers features like auto DevOps and container registry.

4. Bitbucket Pipelines:
   A CI/CD service provided by Atlassian, integrated with Bitbucket repositories. It allows you to define build pipelines using bitbucket-pipelines.yml.

5. Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS):
   A comprehensive set of development tools provided by Microsoft. It includes features for version control, CI/CD, package management, and more.

6. GoCD:
   An open-source continuous delivery server that helps automate and streamline the build-test-deploy cycle for applications.

7. Bamboo:
   Another CI/CD server provided by Atlassian. It offers features like automated builds, deployments, and integrations with other Atlassian tools.

8. TeamCity:
   A powerful and extensible CI server provided by JetBrains. It supports a wide range of programming languages and build tools.

9. Drone:
    An open-source, container-native CI/CD platform. It uses Docker containers to execute builds, making it easy to set up and configure.

10. Semaphore:
    A hosted CI/CD service that offers a simple and easy-to-use interface for setting up pipelines. It supports a variety of programming languages and platforms.

11. Buildkite:
    A CI/CD platform that allows you to run your builds on your own infrastructure. It provides a flexible and customizable environment for setting up pipelines.

12. CodeShip:
    A hosted CI/CD platform that offers a simple and easy-to-configure interface. It supports a variety of programming languages and platforms.

### 3.Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

This setup would be better in a cloud-based environment. Because it is an application being worked on by a team of about 6 people, which is a small to medium software project. A cloud-based solution is probably best for our situation. The configuration is simple and we don't need to go to the hassle or expense of setting up our own system. For smaller projects especially, this should be cheaper. I may need some more information about how large it will be scalling, what other resources are needed, will we collaborate with other teams and projects.
